But as she dissolves into the ritual, something unexpected happens: the thousands of souls she's freeing reach back, holding her together. She transforms - not a servant, not a rebel, but a new kind of being: a Spirit of Liberty. The final scene shows countless Allays, no longer bound to items or masters, dancing together in the sky. Melody leads them, not as a queen, but as a friend. They are finally, truly free."

The moment of choice is extended, showing her entire life of servitude, her struggles for freedom, her joy at helping others. She realizes her choice isn't about death - it's about trust. She trusts the other Allays to carry on without her. The sacrifice becomes a gift, willingly given, and that's what transforms her."
